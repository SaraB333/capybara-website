                <p>SCIENTIFIC NAME: Hydrochoerus Hydrochaeris</p>
                <br>
                <p>DIET: Herbivore</p>
                <br>
                <p>GROUP NAME: Herd</p>
                <br>
                <p>AVERAGE LIFE SPAN IN THE WILD: Up to 7 years</p>
                <br>
                <p>SIZE: 4.6 feet long: up to 2 feet high at shoulders</p>
                <br>
                <p>WEIGHT: 77 to 143 pounds</p>
                <br>
                <p>Capybaras are very vocal animals and communicate with each other through barks, chirps, whistles and
                    purrs. They also use scent glands to mark their territory and to communicate.</p>

            <div class="light-border">
                <h1>Anatomy</h1>
                <p>They can weigh more than 100 lbs (45 kg) and grow to be 4 feet (1.2 m) long and 2 feet (0.6 m) tall.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>They have a heavy, barrel-shaped body which sits on relatively squat legs, shorter in the front than
                    the back. Their red-brown fur is coarse and sparse enough to reveal the grey skin beneath it.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Capybaras have are semi-aquatic with partially webbed feet, which help to propel them through the
                    water or swampy areas.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Similar to a hippopotamus, the capybara’s eyes, nose, and ears are located on the top of its head,
                    allowing it to peek above the surface for a breath of air and a quick check for predators while the
                    bulk of its body remains hidden beneath the water.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The nutrients in grasses differ between the dry season and the wet season. During the dry season,
                    when their food is less nutritious, their small intestine grows, helping to absorb more nutrients.
                    In the wet season, their intestine contracts, as nutritious vegetation is bountiful! This flexible
                    digestive tract is key to their survival.</p>

                <h1>Habitat</h1>
                <p>These semi-aquatic mammals are found throughout much of northern and central South America, though a
                    small invasive population has been seen in Florida.</p>
                <br>
                <p>More specifically, Capybaras are found naturally in Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Guyana, Peru,
                    Brazil, Paraguay, Northeast Argentina and Uruguay.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Capybaras are adapted for life in bodies of water found in forests, seasonally flooded savannas, and
                    wetlands.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Capybaras are naturally threatened by jaguars, caimans and anacondas, and their young can be taken by
                    ocelots and harpy eagles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>When threatened, capybaras will jump into the water and hide beneath the surface. They can hold their
                    breath for almost five minutes!</p>

                <h1>Diet</h1>
                <p>Feeding mostly in the afternoon, and on and off at night, capybaras tend to doze in the morning. They
                    take short naps throughout the day while other members of their group stand guard.</p>
                <br>
                <p>They are herbivores and eat the vegetation that lines water sources and other aquatic plants.</p>
                <br>
                <p>During the dry season or in drought conditions, capybaras will also eat grains, melons, reeds and
                    squashes.</p>
